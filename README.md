AudioSwitcher Modified
================

This has been forked from xenolightning, the main project can be found there. This program allows you to easily enable and disable audio devices by interacting with the system tray icon. Double clicking toggles the audio devices that are selected by right clicking the icon. The form has been emptied, apart from a few settings.
